        <h1>Naming Conventions</h1>
        
        <div class="entry-content">
        <p>While this may sound like a small detail, clear method naming is important to provide an API that developers familiar with event-based programming can pick up quickly.</p>
<p>Since the idea of a method call maps very neatly onto that of a received event, all event handlers are simply methods named after past-tense verbs. All class names are descriptive nouns, designed to mirror the is-a relationship of the abstractions they implement. All requests for notification or transmission are present-tense imperative verbs.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of this naming scheme:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>An event notification of data received from peer:<tt class="docutils literal">dataReceived(data)</tt></li>
<li>A request to send data: <tt class="docutils literal">write(data)</tt></li>
<li>A class that implements a protocol: <tt class="docutils literal">Protocol</tt></li>
</ul>
<p>The naming is platform neutral. This means that the names are equally appropriate in a wide variety of environments, as long as they can publish the required events.</p>
<p>It is self-consistent. Things that deal with TCP use the acronym TCP, and it is always capitalized. Dropping, losing, terminating, and closing the connection are all referred to as &quot;losing&quot; the connection. This symmetrical naming allows developers to easily locate other API calls if they have learned a few related to what they want to do.</p>
<p>It is semantically clear. The semantics of dataReceived are simple: there are some bytes available for processing. This remains true even if the lower-level machinery to get the data is highly complex.</p>
