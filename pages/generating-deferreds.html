<p><cite>Deferred &lt;twisted.internet.defer.Deferred&gt;</cite> objects are
signals that a function you have called does not yet have the data you want
available. When a function returns a Deferred object, your calling function
attaches callbacks to it to handle the data when available.</p>
<p>This document addresses the other half of the question: writing functions
that return Deferreds, that is, constructing Deferred objects, arranging for
them to be returned immediately without blocking until data is available, and
firing their callbacks when the data is available.</p>
<p>This document assumes that you are familiar with the asynchronous model used
by Twisted, and with <a class="reference external" href="https://judgegregg.github.io/pelitwi/pages/deferred-reference.html">using deferreds returned by functions</a>

<p>You will notice that despite creating a Deferred in the  <tt class="docutils literal">largeFibonnaciNumber</tt> function, these things happened:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the "Total time taken for largeFibonnaciNumber call" output
shows that the function did not return immediately as asynchronous functions
are expected to do; and</li>
<li>rather than the callback being added before the result was available and
called after the result is available, it isn't even added until after the
calculation has been completed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The function completed its calculation before returning, blocking the
process until it had finished, which is exactly what asynchronous functions
are not meant to do.  Deferreds are not a non-blocking talisman: they are a
signal for asynchronous functions to <em>use</em> to pass results onto
callbacks, but using them does not guarantee that you have an asynchronous
function.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Returning Deferreds from synchronous functions</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes you might wish to return a Deferred from a synchronous function.
There are several reasons why, the major two are maintaining API compatibility
with another version of your function which returns a Deferred, or allowing
for the possibility that in the future your function might need to be
asynchronous.</p>
<p>In the <a class="reference external" href="https://judgegregg.github.io/pelitwi/pages/deferred-reference.html">Using Deferreds</a> reference, we gave the
following example of a synchronous function:</p>
<p><cite>synch-validation.py &lt;listings/deferred/synch-validation.py&gt;</cite></p>
<p>While we can require that callers of our function wrap our synchronous
result in a Deferred using <cite>maybeDeferred &lt;twisted.internet.defer.maybeDeferred&gt;</cite> , for the sake of API
compatibility it is better to return a Deferred ourselves using  <cite>defer.succeed &lt;twisted.internet.defer.succeed&gt;</cite> :</p>

<div class="section" id="integrating-blocking-code-with-twisted">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Integrating blocking code with Twisted</a></h2>
<p>At some point, you are likely to need to call a blocking function: many
functions in third party libraries will have long running blocking functions.
There is no way to 'force' a function to be asynchronous: it must be written
that way specifically. When using Twisted, your own code should be
asynchronous, but there is no way to make third party functions asynchronous
other than rewriting them.</p>
<p>In this case, Twisted provides the ability to run the blocking code in a
separate thread rather than letting it block your application. The <cite>twisted.internet.threads.deferToThread</cite> function will set up
a thread to run your blocking function, return a Deferred and later fire that
Deferred when the thread completes.</p>
<p>Let's assume our <tt class="docutils literal">largeFibonnaciNumber</tt> function
from above is in a third party library (returning the result of the
calculation, not a Deferred) and is not easily modifiable to be finished in
discrete blocks. This example shows it being called in a thread, unlike in the
earlier section we'll see that the operation does not block our entire
program:</p>

<div class="section" id="possible-sources-of-error">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Possible sources of error</a></h2>
<p>Deferreds greatly simplify the process of writing asynchronous code by
providing a standard for registering callbacks, but there are some subtle and
sometimes confusing rules that you need to follow if you are going to use
them. This mostly applies to people who are writing new systems that use
Deferreds internally, and not writers of applications that just add callbacks
to Deferreds produced and processed by other systems. Nevertheless, it is good
to know.</p>
<div class="section" id="firing-deferreds-more-than-once-is-impossible">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Firing Deferreds more than once is impossible</a></h3>
<p>Deferreds are one-shot. You can only call <tt class="docutils literal">Deferred.callback</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">Deferred.errback</tt> once. The processing chain continues each time
you add new callbacks to an already-called-back-to Deferred.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="synchronous-callback-execution">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Synchronous callback execution</a></h3>
<p>If a Deferred already has a result available, <tt class="docutils literal">addCallback</tt> <strong>may</strong> call the callback synchronously: that is, immediately
after it's been added.  In situations where callbacks modify state, it is
might be desirable for the chain of processing to halt until all callbacks are
added. For this, it is possible to <tt class="docutils literal">pause</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">unpause</tt>
a Deferred's processing chain while you are adding lots of callbacks.</p>
<p>Be careful when you use these methods! If you <tt class="docutils literal">pause</tt> a
Deferred, it is <em>your</em> responsibility to make sure that you unpause it.
The function adding the callbacks must unpause a paused Deferred, it should <em>never</em> be the responsibility of the code that actually fires the
callback chain by calling <tt class="docutils literal">callback</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">errback</tt> as
this would negate its usefulness!</p>
